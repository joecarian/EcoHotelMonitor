2. It enables administrators to seamlessly generate energy reports of the various hotel and securely transmit them via blockchain technology.
3. It aids hotel administrators in monitoring
their energy consumption through the display of total
energy production and usage. In addition, it identifies
days with excessive energy usage to facilitate the
reduction of carbon footprint.
